# Automatic Certificate Sender 

Automatic Certificate Sender is a self initiative project that I created for my college society to send Certificate to the participants through a csv file. 




## How to use

Step 1 - clone the project in your system 

```bash
  gh repo clone ayyyushhhhh/automatic_email_sender
```
    
Step 2 - Add csv file that contains the participants name in the root folder.

Step 3 - Add Certificates to the root folder. 

Note: Make sure Certificate file name should be same as the names in the csv file. 

Step 4 - run the python script 

```bash
  python email_automation.py
```
